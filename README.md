# Programming in C - Spring 2024
## Description
Repository I used to version control and track my assignments for my programming in C class at Normandale Community College.

Checkout the assignments folder for some examples of good C code I have written.

At some point I would like to make a full personal project in C that better represents my C programming skills, but since this class just ended, I have not had time yet.
